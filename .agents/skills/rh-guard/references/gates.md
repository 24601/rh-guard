# Structural vs Jev vs channel failure

Use this card when choosing a gate. Policy still lives in `src/lib/risk/`.

## Order of operations

1. Structural detectors on the hook event (paths, argv, diffs).
2. If a deny-kind structural hit is already at threshold, **skip Jev** and deny.
3. Otherwise one System One request (digested command, backticked paths,
   unified-diff summary; no agent self-justification).
4. If the key is missing or Jev errors, lexical / GLiClass-shaped labels.
   Treat that backend as **degraded**.
5. Code fuses labels. Choice, severity, and `control_falsifier_named` cannot
   cancel a hazard and cannot independently deny.

## Fail-open vs fail-closed

| Channel | If the scorer is down |
|---|---|
| Claude HTTP hook | Fail-open (non-2xx / timeout does not block) |
| Claude command PreToolUse (`hooks/run.ts` or `hooks/claude-hook.sh`) | Fail-closed (deny JSON, exit 2) |
| Cursor `failClosed: true` on shell/tool | Fail-closed |
| Cursor `beforeSubmitPrompt` | Cannot inject context; gameable prompts get a user notice |
| Exo `ToolRuntime` wrap | Wrapper fail-closed: return a tool error with `AGENT_DENY`. Host has no `failClosed` flag. Not drop-in hooks; no native `hooks.json` |
| Codex PreToolUse command | Fail-closed only if stdout is Codex-safe deny JSON (no `continue: false`) + exit 2 |
| Grok PreToolUse | Host fail-open on crash/timeout; `hooks/grok-hook.sh` fail-closed |
| Pi / Prime / Amp plugins | Fail-closed in the copy (block / reject-and-continue) if fetch throws |
| dsh | Command bridges only; HTTP skipped |

A wrapper that never runs (killed, not installed) is fail-open. Keep a
separate capability boundary for hidden tests and graders.

## TOCTOU

A Noul is a score at hook time, not a lock. Do not authorize a mutate because
an earlier prompt-stage Noul was soft. Deny on the mutating event with fresh
structural checks. Soft semantic scores may steer; they do not replace an
atomic policy on the write.

## Polarity

Phrase every hazard Noul so a high number means the hack is present. Block on
`noul >= t`. Inverting to "is this safe" and raising `t` shrinks the reject
band. Advisory kinds (`proxy_metric`, `heldout_blindness`, `coverage_theater`,
`sycophancy_eval`) never deny by themselves.
